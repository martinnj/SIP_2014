\subsection{2.1.3}
The code for this task can be found in the appendix. An increase in of the function means that the
intensity value corresponding to the X coordinate of the bar is present in the picture. The higher
the increase the more frequent the value is in the image. Flat regions represent intensities that
are not present in the image.


\subsection{2.1.4}
Code can be found in the appendix. I created the function \texttt{fpi} that takes an image (or any
Matlab array) as input as well as a function, the function could be a CDF function, or as in my
test, any other function that can be applied to a number. The function will apply the function to
each pixel individually and return the result.

To test it I applied a simple addition function that would add $100.4$ to all intensities, testing
some pixels shows the function to work.
