\section{Task 1.3}

This task was solved by using a for loop and an array function to extract a
given bit for all pixels at once and order it into sub plots. See appendix for
source code.

Just like in the books Figure 1.3 on page 5, we see that the most significant
bits contain most of the coarse image information so the lower bits resembles
noise. Since this is a grayscale image where objects that er visible are whiter
(intensity close to 255) it makes sense that objects are visible in the higher
bit planes. Thw lower bit planes encompas only small variations in the visiblity
but a change in for isntance the 8'th bit will change the intensity with 128, or
half of the possible intensity.
