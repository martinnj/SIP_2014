\section{Task 2}
The code for creating Figure \ref{fig:p2} can be found in the appendix.

\graphicc{1}{img/p2.png}{The two upper rows are images, their sinograms and the backprojection
of their sinograms. The lower row is a sinogram, the same sinogram rotated and finally the back
projection of the rotated sinogram.}{fig:p2}

The backprojection is written as the formula
\begin{align*}
    f_{bp}(x,y) = \int_0^{\pi} p(x\sin\phi + y\cos\phi , \phi)d\phi \\
\end{align*}
