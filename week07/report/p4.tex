\section{Task 4}
The code for creating Figure \ref{fig:p41} can be found in the appendix.

\graphicc{0.6}{img/rice.png}{The original \textit{rice.png} image.}{fig:p4original}
\graphicc{0.8}{img/p41.png}{The result of background normalization using different sizes for the disk.}{fig:p41}

When looking at Figure \ref{fig:p41} I think the best results come from an $r$-value of either $r=7$ or $r=8$.
These have the least amount of noise in the remaining background and still maintain enough foreground
that differences in each rice can be seen. It is worth noticing that this $r$ value is very close to
the approximate width of each individual rice.
