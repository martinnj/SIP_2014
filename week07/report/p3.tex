\section{Task 3}
Figure \ref{fig:p3orig} shows the image used as base for this task.

The code for producing Figure \ref{fig:p311}, Figure \ref{fig:p312} and Figure \ref{fig:p313} can be
found in the appendix.

In this section I test several morphological functions with different structuring elements, the following functions are tested:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Hit-Miss] The logical and  of the image $A$eroded with a structuring element $B$ and the
    image eroded with the inverse of the structuring element, $B_i$. Formally written as:
   \[ A \otimes B = (A \ominus B) \intersect (A \iminus B_i) \]
   It is used for extracting and finding features in the foreground that are similar/akin to the structuring element.
   
   \item[Top Hat] Subtraction of the opened version of the image from the original image $A$. Formally written as:
   \[ A - (A \ominus B) \oplus B \]
   It extracts elements that are smaller than the structuring element and have higher intensities than their neighbourhood.
   
   \item[Bottom Hat] Subtraction of an image $A$ from the closed version of that image.Formally written as:
   \[ ((A \oplus B) \ominus B) - A \]
   It extracts elements that are smaller than the structuring element and have lower intensities than their neighbourhood.
\end{itemize}

I did this test with 3 different shapes of structuring elements, the diamond, the octagon and the square.
Figure \ref{fig:p311} shows the result of applying the functions using a diamond structuring element with radius $r=1..4$.
Figure \ref{fig:p312} shows the result of applying the functions using a octagon structuring element with radius $r=3, 6, 9$ and $12$.
Figure \ref{fig:p313} shows the result of applying the functions using a box structuring element with height/width $r=1..4$.
