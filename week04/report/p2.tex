\section{Task 2}
\subsection{Part a}
First, lets substitute equation 5 into equation 6 from the assignment we get
\begin{align}
  H(x,y,\tau) &= I_{xx}(x,y,\tau) + I_{yy}(x,y,\tau) \\
              &= \tau^{\gamma(2+0)} \frac{\partial^2(x,y,\tau)}{\partial x^2} + \tau^{\gamma(0+2)}\frac{\partial^2I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial y^2} \\
              &= \tau^2 \frac{\partial^2I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial x^2} + \tau^2\frac{\partial^2I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial y^2} \\
              &= \tau^2 \left(\frac{\partial^2I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2I(x,y,\tau)}{\partial y^2}\right) \\
              &= \tau^2 \left( I(x+1,y,\tau )+I(x-1,y,\tau )-4I(x,y,\tau )+I(x,y+1,\tau )+I(x,y-1,\tau ) \right)
\end{align}
which is the analytical expression we are looking for.

\subsection{Part b/c/d}
I am unsure how to do partial derivatives on the convolution operation needed in order to do a proper
derivation of $I(x,y,\tau)$ in the analytical case. I tried using Matlab to convolve the gaussian and
still maintain the symbols needed to do derivation and equation solving later, but was unable to do so.

Note that this problem also persists for Task 3, which I was unable to complete.
