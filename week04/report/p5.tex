\section{Task 5}

The code for creating Figure \ref{fig:p5} can be found in the appendix.

function with different frequency band filters.}{fig:p5}

Figure \ref{fig:p5} shows the original \textit{lena.tif} image as well as the noisy version and
different recovered version. The recovered version are produced by using the inverse filtering
technique and applying a band pass filter in order to eliminate noise. I tried several different
frequencies for the filter, the ones showed in the figure are a select few that represent the most
obvious changes in the output. We can see that the filter works best around $0.1$ and $0.2$.
Higher and lower causes the image to degrade into noise again. It is worth noticing that the noise
is different for high and low frequency filters. It is worth noticing that Matlab makes a render
error when thee frequency is $1$, at this value, all of the data gets stripped and all the pixels
take on the same value $104.7xxx$ where the last digits very from run to run, but it is always the
same value for all pixels. So the image should be monotone.
